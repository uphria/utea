#CONSIDERATIONS

#test the least dependent function first
#test each subsequent function knowing that what it relies upon is correct
#for each function, use both black box and white box testing
#find sources of errors
#once you find there is error, using techniqus to track down the problem:
    #drawing pictures to figure out the inner workings
    #print statements to determine what the inner workings actually are
    #using comments to narrow down the focus of your investigation
